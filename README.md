# Where am I?
This repo contains the files for the presentation, _*"Do You Want to Build an Add-in"*_ that will be demonstrated at [Autodesk University 2019](https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=319568&tclass=popup#.Xb3Qubqa2wA). Since this presentation is about getting started with Revit add-ins, it seemed fitting to build it using version control.

# Who?
Presenter - John Pierson of [ParallaxTeam](http://www.parallaxteam.com/) and [sixtysecondrevit.com](http://sixtysecondrevit.com/).
